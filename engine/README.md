--------------------------------------------


for released files, look at:

	https://github.com/max1220/lgj2019


This repository contains the source code of the for this purpose written engine, and the actual game code.

For the libraries used(also partially (re-)written for this game jam), see:

	https://github.com/max1220/lua-db
	https://github.com/max1220/lua-fb
	https://github.com/max1220/lua-input
	https://github.com/max1220/lua-time
	lua-cjson for tiled map loading
	lua-imlib2 for loading .png and others
	(probably more, TODO)



TODO
